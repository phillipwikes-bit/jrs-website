// Paginated PostgREST reader.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Supabase caps every REST response at 1,000 rows. The cap is
// applied AFTER the query's own `limit`, it is not an error, and the response
// carries no marker saying it happened: a request for `limit=20000` against a
// 1,031-row table returns 1,000 rows and HTTP 200. Every caller that summed
// those rows therefore reported a number that was silently short, and stayed
// plausible while being wrong.
//
// HOW IT SURFACED. The Investigator Guide download chart stopped at 31 August
// while the database held rows through 7 September. The guide total read 137
// against 145 in the table, a gap of exactly the eight September rows. Rows are
// returned in physical order with no `order` clause, so the rows lost are the
// most recently inserted: the failure always hides the newest data, which is
// the data anyone is actually looking at. The dashboard did not look broken. It
// looked quiet.
//
// THE FIX IS PAGING, NOT A BIGGER LIMIT. A larger `limit` cannot defeat a
// server-side cap. Range headers walk the whole result instead, and the loop
// ends when a page comes back short, so it costs one request on small tables
// and does not need to know any total in advance.
const PAGE = 1000;

// A hard ceiling so a runaway table cannot turn one dashboard request into an
// unbounded read. 100 pages is 100,000 rows, far above anything here, and
// truncation at that point is reported rather than hidden.
const MAX_PAGES = 100;
